### Current Features

The website for Cafe Sebastian is consciously lightweight, with a crips and clean aesthetic; however, it does include a number of features to add structure and increase engagement for visitors.

- Navigation Bar
    - The nav bar is featured prominently at the top of all three pages and allows users to easily navigate betwen the Home, What's On and Contact Us Page. The current page is displayed to the user with coloured text and is underlined.
    - On desktop devices, the bar remains at the top of the users' view, so navigation is available without scrolling. On mobile devices, this detracted from the user experience by obscuring a significant percentage of the screen, so it reverts to remaining at the top of the page on smaller screens.
- Hero Image
    - The large image of the cafe uses a simple zoom animation to attract the eye of the user.
- About Us Images
    - The core tenets of the venue are highlighted for the user in these attractive images- Founders, Mission, Artists, Community.
    - The hover effect reveals more details about each of these areas without cluttering the page with lots of text.
- Event Listing
    - The What's One page is fully responsive for both desktop and mobile devices. 
    - For large screens, it has a pleasing asymmetrical gallery design which allows visitors to see all of the upcoming events at a glance. For smaller devices, it displays with events in a single column, ordered by date.
    - The hover effect, which changes the colours for the relevant event, creates dynamic feedback for the user.
- Contact Us Form
    - The simple form allows visitors to contact the venue directly
- Footer
    - The footer, which appears on every page, displays the opening hours as well as containing links (which open in a new tab) to the relevant social media pages.

### Future Features
Planned future features might include:
- Back to Top button
    - Adding a "Back to Top" button for display on small screens would make returning to the navigation bar easier for the user. Currently, this is not a significant problem, but if the What's On page contained more than 6 events, it might be a useful addition.
- Booking via Whats On page
    - Adding the ability to book for concerts directly through the What's On page would improve the user experience and is likely to help drive ticket sales for the venue.

## Design Elements
The following colour scheme was used throughout the design of the website. It is a palette that was derived from one of the yellow hues of the furniture in the hero image. It offers a neutral palette but with two clear options emphasis.
